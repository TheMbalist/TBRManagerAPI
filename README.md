<h1>TBRMAnagerAPI<h1></h1>

<p>This is a project I've created to practice my REST APIs skills and also practice using Git and Github.</p>

<p>This project consists of 3 entities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TBR (which is named Book_List in the database)</li>
  <li>CurrentlyReading</li>
  <li>BooksRead</li>
</ul>

<p>These entities and their data are stored in an H2 Database which is accessed in the browser while running the project. The user is, for now, able to view the date via the command line or by entering values using a browser link. A user can GET, POST and put (update) data in the three tables.</p>

<h2>Below are some examples of some of the endpoints created:</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before I used this project as an opportunity to practice using Git and Github for this project.</p>
